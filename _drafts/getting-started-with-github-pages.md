Progressive Tutelage is hosted as a Github Pages user site. As such, it is a static HTML blog generated by Jekyll. I found several good tutorials on setting up a Github blog, but they usually stopped once the site was created. They didn't describe how to keep going with Jekyll. Once I started looking for a theme, I noticed that a lot of themes use Octopress. Instructions on getting things going with the themes were harder to find. Then after I choose a theme, I realized it is using a new version of Octopress and there is hardly any documentation about Octopress 3. After some work, I finally got everything together and working. So here is how I did it.

A Github Pages site is a special git repository on Github that contains your blog. You can put static HTML pages in the repository or you can use Jekyll to build the site. Every time a change on the master branch is pushed to Github, the repository is run through Jekyll to build the site. It is a great way to easily build a site you have full control over.

## Setup Your Github Repository

The first thing you need is to get your site's repository set up on Github.com. A Github Pages site is a special git repository hosted on Github.com. For a user site, you must create the repository with the following name, replacing username with your Github username: `username.github.io`. For example, I created a repository named `jpangborn.github.io`.

Now you have a Github Pages repository.

## Clone the Repository

You will most likely want to work on your blog on you computer, not on Github.com, so you will want to clone the repository. You could use Github for Windows or Github for Mac to clone the repository, but I prefer the command line. Most tutorials give you the basic Git clone command, but you end up with a folder named `username.github.io`. I don't find that very friendly to work with. So I used the following git command to clone the repository

{% highlight bash %}
git clone git://github.com/jpangborn/jpangborn.github.io Blog
{% endhighlight %}

You will need to replace `jpangborn` with your username. The `Blog` at the end is the directory where the repository will be cloned. You can use any directory name you like here. At this point, you now have a starting point to build your site.

## Install Octopress, Jekyll, and Dependencies

You could start putting HTML, CSS, and Javascript here, but it isn't easy to maintain a blog with static HTML and CSS. Since Github Pages support Jekyll, we will get that setup. We will also install Octopress, which makes working with Jekyll on the command line easier. We need to take care of a few prerequisites first. Jekyll is written in Ruby, so we need to install the first. There are many ways to install ruby. The following instructions are for Mac OS X and can all be run from the `Blog` directory.

### Install Homebrew

I have found Homebrew to be the easiest method to install and manage Ruby on the Mac. Execute the following command in terminal to install Homebrew.

{% highlight bash %}
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)"
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have Homebrew installed, you should update the formula by executing the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
brew update
{% endhighlight %}

### Install Ruby-Build and RBENV

I use RBENV and Ruby-Build to install and manage Ruby. RBENV lets you switch between different Ruby versions and set specific versions for different projects. Ruby-Build is an RBENV plug-in that allows you to easily download, build and install specific versions of Ruby. Install RBENV and Ruby-Build with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
brew install rbenv ruby-build
{% endhighlight %}

Once they have completed, there is one final step to setting up RBENV. Execute the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
{% endhighlight %}

Now you are ready to install Ruby.

### Install Ruby

Install Ruby with the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
rbenv install 2.1.0
{% endhighlight %}

This may take a while as ruby is downloaded and compiled.

#### Set Ruby Verison

Run the following command to set your Ruby version to 2.1.0.

{% highlight bash %}
rbenv global 2.1.0
{% endhighlight %}

### Install Bundler

Once Ruby is installed, you will need to install Bundler, the Ruby package manager. It can be installed with the following command.

{% highlight bash %}
gem install bundler
{% endhighlight %}

### Install Jekyll and Octopress

Since we have Bundler installed, we just need to declare the Jekyll and Octopress as site dependencies. Create a file with the following contents:

{% highlight ruby %}
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'github-pages'
gem 'octopress', '~> 3.0.0.rc.12'
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file in your `Blog` directory with the name `Gemfile`. Then execute the following command to install Octopress, Jekyll, and all their dependencies.

{% highlight bash %}
bundle install
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you have all the software needed to build a Jekyll blog, but we don't have anything to build yet. At this point, stage and commit the files in git with the following commands.

{% highlight bash %}
git add .
git commit -m "Add Gemfile"
{% endhighlight %}

Now we need to get some blog content setup.

## Setup Your Blog

Before you start writing any posts, you should get the site structure and design built. You could do this by starting form scratch or by installing a theme.

### Starting from Scratch

You can setup a new Jekyll site by running the following command from the `Blog` directory.

{% highlight bash %}
octopress new . --force
{% endhighlight %}

From here, you will need to create all your templates and content. See the [Jekyll Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) for the full details on Jekyll.

### Starting from a Theme

It is much easier to start from a theme. You can find a bunch of great themes at the following Jekyll themes sites: [JekyllThemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org) or [JekyllThemes.net](http://www.jekyllthemes.net).

I choose the [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme by Michael Rose.

## Installing the Theme

Many of the themes start with instructions to clone the theme's repository. I don't like this option since your site repository already exists. I prefer just downloading the files and extracting them to the `Blog` directory.

Once this is done, you will have all the files needed to finalize your blog. But there is some settings that need to be customized to your site.

## Customizing the Theme

The main configuration for a Jekyll site is contained in the `_config.yml` file. Follow the instructions of the theme to customize the `_config.yml` file. Each theme will be slightly different. You can set a number Jekyll options here, but you can also add data that can be used in the templates.
