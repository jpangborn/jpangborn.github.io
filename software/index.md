I spend much of my time writing software. Often as simple as SQL rules in Banner, to realtime processing APIs, to complex full featured web applications. I openly release as much of my code as I am able. I host my open source software at [Github](http://www.github.com/jpangborn). Below are descriptions of all my open source project, other projects to which I have committed, and some closed source projects.

## My Open Source Software

### Railscasts Theme for Toad

I am a big fan of the [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com) theme for Textmate. Since I spend much of my time in Toad, I ported the color scheme. It isn't an exact port, but it works pretty well.

### Banner File Import Scripts

Simple MS-DOS Batch scripts for automating the archiving and combining of ISIRs, Direct Loan, and Pell files before importing into Ellucian Banner. More details about these scripts is available in the post: [Combine ISIRs for Faster Import]({% post_url 2012-02-12-combine-isirs-for-faster-import %}).

### Banner Web Snapshot Panes

A suite of web snapshot panes to build custom layouts in Banner Self-Service. Covers a wide range of panes related to Financial Aid, Student, and Accounts Receivable data. For more information, see the posts: [Introduction to Web Snapshot]({% post_url 2013-03-20-introduction-to-web-snapshot %}) and [Writing Web Snapshot Panes]({% post_url 2013-03-25-writing-web-snapshot-panes %}).

### Banner Period Budgeting Rules

Period and Algorithmic Budgeting in Banner is very powerful, but can be very complex to setup. This project includes all of my rules and supporting packages and views.

## Projects I Contribute To

### Oracle Bundle for Sublime Text

I prefer working in a simple text editor rather than Toad when I can. To that end, I have been contributing to the Oracle bunlde for Sublime Text. If their you are a Sublime Text and Oracle user and would like an improvement to the Oracle bundle, please open an issue on Github and I will see what I can do.

## Other Projects

Below are other projects I have worked on. They range from simple websites to SmartSearch, a full-fledged web application.

### SmartSearch

SmartSearch is a tool to help high school students search for and compare colleges based on the students’ likelihood of getting admitted and their families’ ability to afford the school. The software estimates an EFC and estimates the student’s financial aid at each college compared. It also calculates a likelihood of admission based on the student’s high school academics. Once in the report, the user can enter some basic financial data to determine how well the family may be able to afford the each college. Visit [Stratagee](http://www.stratagee.com/advisors.php#smartseach) for more information.

## Websites

### Anchor Point Archery

Anchor Point Archery was a non-profit Christian outreach ministry of Calvary Chapel of Russell. I built their website with Bootstrap and jQuery hosted it on Heroku. (I love git deployment.)

### Esther’s Country Kitchen

Esther’s Country Kitchen is the site for a Mechanicsburg, PA caterer that I did the programming for.
