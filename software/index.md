I write web-based software. I enjoy learning the ins and outs of a new field and helping to bring that field into software. Contact me at joshua.pangborn@gmail.com if you would like to discuss your software needs.

## SmartSearch

SmartSearch is a tool to help high school students search for and compare colleges based on the students’ likelihood of getting admitted and their families’ ability to afford the school. The software estimates an EFC and estimates the student’s financial aid at each college compared. It also calculates a likelihood of admission based on the student’s high school academics. Once in the report, the user can enter some basic financial data to determine how well the family may be able to afford the each college.

## YBS

YBS is SmartSearch’s big brother. What SmartSearch does for a single student for their first year of college, YBS does for a family for all the years they have students in school. YBS collects a lot of demographic, educational, and financial data and then run an algorithm simulating the family’s ability to fund their education plans. It takes into account Financial Aid, Personal Resources and Tax Aid to determine if the family can afford their education plans.

## Anchor Point Archery

Anchor Point Archery is a is a non-profit Christian outreach ministry of Calvary Chapel of Russell. Their facility offers several adult and youth indoor archery ranges, an outdoor archery range, and an archery shop. I built their website. For now, it is a basic informational site, but there are plans to build some membership features into it at a later date. I built it with Bootstrap and jQuery. It is hosted on Heroku. (I love git deployment.)

## Esther’s Country Kitchen

Esther’s Country Kitchen is the site for a local caterer that I did the programming for.
