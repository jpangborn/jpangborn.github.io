I have moved my blog again. I originally started blogging on Wordpress quite a few years ago, but was never very consistent. I moved to Posterous for awhile and liked it. Everything was much simpler and I was able to post quite a few articles. Unfortunately, Posterous closed and I moved back to Wordpress. Posts pretty much came to a stop. I just don't like using Wordpress; it is too complicated. I have been meaning to move to a platform where writing was simpler and where I had more control over the site. I finally sat down and decided to get it done. I have had a Github account for a while, so I decided to start using Github Pages.

I also finally chose a name. Most of what I work on relates to Higher Education, and my days are spent building on top of earlier work. I rarely create something from scratch, but typically start from earlier work to improve it. I like the sound and idea of Progressive Tutelage. Constantly learning, constantly iterating, constantly improving. That is my work life and that is what I want bring here.

It has been quite a busy year and half. I have been at Berea College for over a year now. It has been a whirlwind year of learning new stuff and getting comfortable with a new environment. After a year, I think I am settled in. I have encountered so much new stuff in the last year and I have a running list in my head of things I want to share.

I am eager to share and hoping to finally start posting consistently.
