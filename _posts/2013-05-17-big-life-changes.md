For a long time, I have been trying to be more consistent with writing for this blog. It isn’t always easy, but this time, my absence has a good reason. My family and I have been in the midst of a big move. In late March, I accepted a position at Berea College in Berea, KY. This necessitated a large move for us from Pennsylvania to Kentucky. The last two months have been consumed with this move, from selling our house to finishing as many of the projects I was working on at Messiah as I could.

I am now a Systems Implementation and Integration Analyst at Berea College. Long title, I know. I am still working with Banner Financial Aid, but am looking forward to new challenges in integrating other software with Banner. Berea has a different Financial Aid process compared to Messiah, so I will be listening and learning for awhile. My hope is that this will broaden my knowledge in Banner. And in the long run, I hope to bring greater automation and efficiency to Berea’s Financial Aid process.

Our move isn’t complete yet. We are still in the process of selling our house in Pennsylvania. (Should be complete soon.) So we are renting in Berea for the time being while we search for a new house. After owning our home for year, this has been a bit of a challenge for us. We are looking forward to having a place we can really make our own.

Hopefully, as we get fully settled and I get fully ramped up at Berea, I can get back to writing some posts. I have a long list of topics that I would like to write about. I finished a number of projects at Messiah before leaving that I will be creating posts on. The biggest project was Period and Algorithmic Budgeting. I already have the first post on this started. I also finished a big set of security changes to Banner Document Management. I’ll keep the rest to myself for now. I am sure that I will work on some new things at Berea that will be become posts in the future.
