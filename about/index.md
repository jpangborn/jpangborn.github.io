Technology is a tool. A tool that should make our lives and jobs easier. My passion is using technology to make the jobs of others as easy as it can be. That includes solving problems with technology in such a way that those not passionate about it are comfortable using it.

By day, I am a Systems Implementation and Integration Analyst at Berea College. That’s a really long title that just means I make software work together smoothly. I primarily support the Financial Aid module of Ellucian Banner. Prior to Berea College, I spent 8 years at Messiah College supporting Financial Aid both as a programmer and in a functional role. I have also supported the Banner Document Management Suite, which integrates EMC’s ApplicationXtender imaging system with Ellucian’s Banner.

By night, I design and write software for Stratagee, including SmartSearch, YBS, and our corporate website. We write software to enable financial planners, broker dealers, education consultants, and families to plan for the cost of education.

I hope all the solutions that I develop are easy to use and make others jobs and lives as easy as can be.
